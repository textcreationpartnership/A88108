            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath pleaſed Divine Providence <hi>firſt</hi> to wean mee from my Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, <hi>then</hi> from the World, and now <hi>laſtly</hi> from my ſelf: So that I who am naturally of an infirm and crazie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſubject to compliance with the ſtream, and to turn with the <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropium,</hi> am ſupernaturally elevated above common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Spiritually engaged to plead for Chriſt, even in ſuch Malignant times, wherein Chriſt is oppoſed in his Name, Perſon, Offices, Word and Works; when moſt men rather <hi>wag their heads</hi> againſt him, then truly <hi>vail their bonnets</hi> and bow their knee before him.</p>
            <p>There have been times wherein this Subject might have fallen into the <hi>boſom of Nurſes,</hi> but now it is like to fall into the <hi>hands of Step-dames.</hi> PRESBYTERIE is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Marah,</hi> though indeed ſhee bee a <hi>Naomi;</hi> and every man will crie up the <hi>Diana of Licentiouſneſs,</hi> not becauſ it is a right way, but the common Rode both for Libertines and Atheiſts.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:162062:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Elijah, John Baptiſt, Luther</hi> had their times, which though perilous to themſelvs, yet they accepted as advantageous to their Maſter: and <hi>Paul</hi> conſulted with the Spirit and Faith, while Fleſh and Blood would have made him a Renegado to Chriſt and the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But ſo weak are wee, that there is need of reaſons to whet our Zeal as well as examples to ſtrengthen it; let us conſider that not onely the Cauſ but alſo the Succeſs is God's. <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> died in their beds, while <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſ Prophet die's by the ſword: and <hi>Tecelius</hi> die's wounded with grief by his own Partie.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is a conſiderable truth, that God look's not onely at the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the dutie, but at the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> that attend it: and that hee delight's in <hi>Adverbs</hi> more then in <hi>Neuns;</hi> and love's <hi>bene</hi> better then <hi>bonum</hi> it ſelf: Therefore though it bee well taken that Chriſtians fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt when all men crie <hi>Hoſanna;</hi> yet it is moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable when all men crie <hi>Crucifie:</hi> though it bee moſt <hi>ſweet</hi> to follow Chriſt when the <hi>Crown</hi> is on his temples, yet it is moſt <hi>meet</hi> to follow him when the <hi>Croſs</hi> is on his back. It is good to own Chriſt on Mount <hi>Calvarie,</hi> as well as Mount <hi>Tabor:</hi> when hee is ſpit upon by an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous generation, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did, the firſt whereof preferred the <hi>reward of Chriſt</hi> above the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Egypt;</hi> the other was not aſhamed of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel when all men caſt ſhame upon it, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 1.16.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom is too like <hi>Iſrael</hi> in bleſſing, and in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs; and therefore may bee called Jidſreel <hi>diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi à Deo,</hi> divided, ſcattered, ruined by the Lord, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee ſtyled Jezrelites then true Iſraelites as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Nathanaël</hi> were.</p>
            <p>God had given us a wiſe, zealous, active, glorious Parliament; but mee think's the beauty and ſplendor
<pb facs="tcp:162062:3"/>fade's as a woman doth after many throwes, and as the body doth after many aguiſh Paroxiſms: no doubt all this for our ſins.</p>
            <p>Mee think's the Scene begin's to change; the Scale which ere while was loweſt now mount's to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able height, and all this too for our iniquities.</p>
            <p>But I had rather diſcuſs the <hi>Cure</hi> then the <hi>Diſeaſ.</hi> Two things muſt recover <hi>England,</hi> and two things muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv it.</p>

            <p>It was <hi>Ignorance</hi> made the <hi>Norvegian</hi> the firſt time hee ſaw Roſes, not dare to touch them, for fear of burning his fingers; and it is no leſs ignorance that make's common people fear a Government.

            <p>Thus (honored Gentlemen, Patriots and Magiſtrates!) I have endeavored a little to poſſeſs you with a candid Interpretation of the preſent Government; and to blow your zeal to an higher flame. If the cauſ bee God's, leave the ſucceſs to him: do but look on and ſtand ſtill if you dare not advance and go forward, and ſee the work of the Lord over in it, and by it God is never wanting to his Church if ſhee bee not wanting to him and her ſelf. Wee complain of ſins and corruptions, and crie out, O the times! but as fondly as the Mother of her childe, which will not uſe the Rod a ſanctified means for recoverie: 'tis not for us to ſay with <hi>Lot</hi> Nay my brethren do not ſo wickedly; nor with <hi>Eli</hi> It is no good report I hear of you.</p>

            <p>Gentlemen! Center not your actions upon your ſelf, bee not emptie vines and ſelf-bearing trees, build not your own houſes and let the houſ of God lie waſte; do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Chriſt, for his Church, for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that both Church and Common-wealth may know yee live not onely a <hi>vegetative</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive,</hi> but a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Life.</hi>

                  <p>Becauſ there are great <hi>animoſities againſt ruleing Elders,</hi> I ſhall bee a little more full in the point.</p>
                  <p>See 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well bee counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double Honor; eſpecially they that labor in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>

                  <p>Againſt this cleer Place, two ſorts of Objections are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly framed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is not a <hi>diſcretive particle,</hi> but <hi>exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> or <hi>explicatory</hi> of the former; as if hee ſhould ſay, All MINISTERS are to be honored, <hi>Eſpecially</hi> they that are diligent in exerciſing the Gift of Preaching.</p>
                  <p>But this cannot ſtand, for it ſeem's to intimate that Miniſters deſerve double Honor for Ruleing Well, though they deſert the principal part of their Duty in Preaching the Goſpel. But can wee expect from the ſame Apoſtle's mouth Sweet, and Bitter? can Hee blow Hot, and Cold? can Hee bleſs a Forbearance, and curſ it too? as hee doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Som conceive hee may mean ſom <hi>Super-annuated Miniſters</hi> that have better <hi>Heads to Rule,</hi> then <hi>Lungs to Preach</hi> unto their Flocks. But I wiſh ſuch Interpreters to conſider;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not fair to ſtart our own Conceits and Notions, and then to father them on the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Adviſe whether there bee much probability in it that there were any ſuch men in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time that could <hi>Govern</hi> but not <hi>Preach,</hi> which is very rare in our dayes, though now Preaching bee a more ſtudious work, and wee have more ſtore of Officers (God bee thanked) then they could have in the Primitive times and firſt Age of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider whether the Apoſtle bee ſo deeply affected with this extraordinarie Caſe, as to lay down a ſpecial and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rule for Such.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether the Apoſtle can bee excuſed in reverencing Younger men above their Elder's, ſuch as are old Standards to the Goſpel, and that (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi> yet) in Senioritie, Gravitie, and Judgment muſt needs excell.</p>
